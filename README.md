This project has evolved from a reworking of [Four Bodhisatva Vows](https://github.com/RoseWagsBlue/FourVows) by RoseWagsBlue. It is now a set of templates for formatting Japanese texts written in kanji.

To install the ` \LaTeX ` package so that it can be used anywhere in the system without the .sty file being in your working directory, just copy the `sutras.sty` file to `texmf-local/tex/latex/sutras` (wherever that might be on your system -- you'll have to create the sutras directory) and then run `texhash` so your latex engine knows where to find the file.

This project has evolved from a reworking of [Four Bodhisatva Vows](https://github.com/RoseWagsBlue/FourVows) by RoseWagsBlue. It is now a set of templates for formatting Japanese texts written in kanji.

To install

```
>$ cp -rv sutras/   ~/.texmf-local/tex/latex ### (or something similar)

>$ texhash    ### now \usepackage{sutras} should enable you to use it systemwide

```

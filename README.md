This project has evolved from a reworking of [Four Bodhisatva Vows](https://github.com/RoseWagsBlue/FourVows) by RoseWagsBlue. It is now a set of templates for formatting Japanese texts written in kanji.

To install just copy the whole contents of the folder to texmf-local/tex/latex/sutras (wherever that might be on your system) and then run `texhash` so your latex engine knows where to find the sutras.sty file.

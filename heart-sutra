Hi,

I really love these tracing sheets, and I especially wanted to share them with the people in a zen calligraphy class I've been attending on zoom. I find sutra tracing a nice combination of spiritual and artistic practice. But it was really bugging me that they aren't lined up :smile:! Maybe its just me (My favorite job at the zen monastery I lived at a few years ago waas usher, because at the end of the night I was supposed to line up all of the cushions and mats in the zendo in perfect straight lines!), but I thought I'd see if I could figure out a way to line things up better. At first I redid everything and the result was a mess --- tons of code and you had to enter the text the opposite way and backwards too. And then I hit on the idea of modfiying your original structure a bit.

I redefined the `\heartblock` to use tcolorboxes in the columns flowing from right to left. Tcolobrboxes come with three parts: a title bar up above, an upper or main ext area and an optional lower text area below that. Everything is contained in a box and you can indivdually style eadh section.

SO first:

get required packages:


```

\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage[left=2cm, right=2cm, top=0.3cm, bottom=0.3cm]{geometry}
\usepackage{nopageno}
\usepackage{multicol}
\usepackage{xeCJK}
\usepackage{anyfontsize}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage[most]{tcolorbox}   %%% does the heavy lifting
```




- Add new `\kanji` command that can be reconfigured from page to the next in case you want to change size and font of main kanji character.
- Add new `\means` command to enable positioning of meanings below main kanji.


\newcommand{\kanji}{\centering\fontsize{70}{70}}
\newcommand{\means}{\tcblower\centering}


Tcolorbox has three elements: a title a main text area and a lower text area. Title will be used for hiaragana (and/or romaji) readings, main text for large gray kanji, lower text area is for one or more lines of meaning and comments.

Set overall style for the components of box by wrapping in a tecolorbox environment. This sets backgrounds and borders to white and text colors to black, gray and black for each element.

```
% new tcolorbox environment
% #1: tcolorbox options
% #2: box title
\newtcolorbox{kanjibox}[2][]
{
	colframe = black!0,
	height=3.55cm,    %%%% fixed height boxes!
	size=small,
	colback  = white,
	colupper= black!30,
	coltitle = black,
	halign title= center,
	fontlower= \scriptsize,
	fonttitle= \small, 
	title    = {#2},
	#1,
}


```

The big change is the each set of kanji, reading, meaning is inside a fixed height box and that size stays the same whether or not one of the feilds is filled. The boxes stack up with the kanji always even balancing teh page. (To my taste at least!)



Redefine `\heartblock` to take 3 parameters instead of 4. The first is the reading, the second is the kanji and the third is the meaning and commentary line breaks acan be used for more than one line in the third section.


```
\newcommand{\heartblock}[3]
{
	\begin{kanjibox}{#1}
		\kanji #2
		\means #3
	\end{kanjibox}
	
}

```


Write as before...


```

\begin{document}
	
\centering 四弘誓願 The Four Bodhisattva Vows

\begin{multicols}{4}
\RLmulticolcolumns

\heartblock{しゅう shu}{衆}{many}
\heartblock{じょう jou}{生}{life \\ 衆生 all living things}
\heartblock{む mu}{無}{nothing}
\heartblock{へん hen}{邊}{boundary \\ 邊 is now 辺,  無辺 limitless}
\heartblock{せい sei}{誓}{vow}
\heartblock{がん gan}{願}{vow  \\ 誓願 vow}
